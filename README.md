# Super Hero Database
In the project I created an app that will allow users to search a database I created for their favorite super heroes or super villains. Users can add, edit, delete, or just search using the search bar.

### Check out the App Below!

### Technologies used
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- React
- Django
- Python

### Challenges Overcome
- Learning to alphabetize an object by passing a function into ```.sort()```.
- Using ```event.preventDefault()``` in the proper places to make the ```post``` and ```put``` requests function as they are supposed to.
- Stopping the ```useEffect()``` from making infite loops with ```searchString``` as a dependency.

### Enjoy!
